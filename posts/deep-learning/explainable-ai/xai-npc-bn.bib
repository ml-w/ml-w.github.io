   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantitative measurement of plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA by real-time PCR at the end of primary treatment is a robust prognostic marker for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. However, up to 40% of patients who would later develop disease recurrence had undetectable post-treatment plasma EBV DNA. Targeted sequencing for the entire EBV genome potentially allows a more comprehensive and unbiased detection of plasma EBV DNA and enables the use of other parameters such as fragment size as biomarkers. Hence, we explored if plasma EBV DNA sequencing might allow more accurate prognostication of NPC patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma samples collected from 769 patients with stage IIB-IVB NPC at 6-8 weeks after radiotherapy were analysed using targeted sequencing for EBV DNA. RESULTS: The sensitivities of the PCR-based analysis, at a cut-off of any detectable levels of plasma EBV DNA, for prediction of local and distant recurrences were 42.3% and 85.3%, respectively. The sequencing-based analysis (involving quantitation and size profiling) achieved better performance for both local and distant recurrences than PCR. Using a cut-off of the proportion of plasma EBV DNA deduced by sequencing at 0.01%, the sensitivities of the sequencing-based analysis for local and distant recurrences were 88.5% and 97.1%, with the resultant negative predictive values of 99.1% and 99.4%, respectively. Among patients with undetectable EBV DNA on quantitative PCR, sequencing could further define a subgroup that enjoyed superior survival outcomes based on the proportion of plasma EBV DNA, with a 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) approaching 90%. On multivariate analysis, sequencing-based quantitative level of plasma EBV DNA was the independent prognostic factor with the highest hazard ratio for prediction of overall survival and PFS. CONCLUSION: NPC prognostication using post-treatment plasma EBV DNA could be enhanced through sequencing.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circulating cell-free Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA is a biomarker for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We conducted a prospective study to investigate whether EBV DNA in plasma samples would be useful to screen for early nasopharyngeal carcinoma in asymptomatic persons. METHODS: We analyzed EBV DNA in plasma specimens to screen participants who did not have symptoms of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Participants with initially positive results were retested approximately 4 weeks later, and those with persistently positive EBV DNA in plasma underwent nasal endoscopic examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: A total of 20,174 participants underwent screening. EBV DNA was detectable in plasma samples obtained from 1112 participants (5.5%), and 309 (1.5% of all participants and 27.8% of those who initially tested positive) had persistently positive results on the repeated sample. Among these 309 participants, 300 underwent endoscopic examination, and 275 underwent both endoscopic examination and MRI; of these participants, 34 had nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A significantly higher proportion of participants with nasopharyngeal carcinoma that was identified by screening had stage I or II disease than in a historical cohort (71% vs. 20%, P<0.001 by the chi-square test) and had superior 3-year progression-free survival (97% vs. 70%; hazard ratio, 0.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.18). Nine participants declined to undergo further testing, and 1 of them presented with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma 32 months after enrollment. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma developed in only 1 participant with negative EBV DNA in plasma samples within 1 year after testing. The sensitivity and specificity of EBV DNA in plasma samples in screening for nasopharyngeal carcinoma were 97.1% and 98.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of EBV DNA in plasma samples was useful in screening for early asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma was detected significantly earlier and outcomes were better in participants who were identified by screening than in those in a historical cohort.

The differential diagnostic performance between NPC and benign hyperplasia were compared among models using chi-square test. Segmentation evaluation metrics, including dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and average surface distance (ASD), were compared using paired student's t-test between T1WIC and T1WI or T2WI models or M_T1/T2, a merged output of malignant region derived from T1WI and T2WI models.Results: All models exhibited similar satisfactory diagnostic performance in discriminating NPC from benign hyperplasia, all attaining overall accuracy over 99.00% in all T stages of NPC. And T1WIC model exhibited similar average DSC and ASD with those of M_T1/T2 (DSC, 0.768 +/- 0.070 vs 0.764 +/- 0.070; ASD, 1.573 +/- 10.954 mm vs 1.626 +/- 10.975 mm 1.626 +/- 0.975 mm vs 1.573 +/- 0.954 mm , all p > 0.0167) in primary NPC using DenseNet, but yielded a significantly higher DSC and lower ASD than either T1WI model or T2WI model (DSC, 0.759 +/- 0.065 or 0.755 +/- 0.071; ASD, 1.661 +/- 0.898 mm or 1.722 +/- 1.133 mm, respectively, all p < 0.01) in the entire test set of NPC cohort. Moreover, the average DSCs and ASDs were not statistically significant between T1WIC model and M_T1/T2 in both. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop a dual-task model to detect and segment nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) automatically in magnetic resource images (MRI) based on deep learning method, since the differential diagnosis of NPC and atypical benign hyperplasia was difficult and the radiotherapy target contouring of NPC was labor-intensive. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A self-constrained 3D DenseNet (SC-DenseNet) architecture was improved using separated training and validation sets. A total of 4100 individuals were finally enrolled and split into the training, validation and test sets at a proximate ratio of 8:1:1 using simple randomization. The diagnostic metrics of the established model against experienced radiologists was compared in the test set. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of manual and model-defined tumor region was used to evaluate the efficacy of segmentation. RESULTS: Totally, 3142 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and 958 benign hyperplasia were included. The SC-DenseNet model showed encouraging performance in detecting NPC, attained a higher overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity than those of the experienced radiologists (97.77% vs 95.87%, 99.68% vs 99.24% and 91.67% vs 85.21%, respectively). Moreover, the model also exhibited promising performance in automatic segmentation of tumor region in NPC, with an average DSC at 0.77 +/- 0.07 in the test set. CONCLUSIONS: The SC-DenseNet model showed competence in automatic detection and segmentation of NPC in MRI, indicating the promising application value as an assistant tool in clinical practice, especially in screening project.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We evaluated modifications to our contrast-enhanced MR imaging grading system for symptomatic patients with suspected nasopharyngeal carcinoma, aimed at improving discrimination of early-stage cancer and benign hyperplasia. We evaluated a second non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging grading system for asymptomatic patients from nasopharyngeal carcinoma plasma screening programs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dedicated nasopharyngeal MR imaging before (plain scan system) and after intravenous contrast administration (current and modified systems) was reviewed in patients from a nasopharyngeal carcinoma-endemic region, comprising 383 patients with suspected disease without nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 383 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The modified and plain scan systems refined primary tumor criteria, added a nodal assessment, and expanded the system from 4 to 5 grades. The overall combined sensitivity and specificity of the 3 systems were compared using the extended McNemar test (a chi(2) value [Formula: see text]> 5.99 indicates significance). RESULTS: The current, modified, and plain scan MR imaging systems yielded sensitivities of 99.74%, 97.91%, and 97.65%, respectively, and specificities of 63.45%, 89.56% and 86.42%, respectively. The modified system yielded significantly better performance than the current ([Formula: see text] = 122) and plain scan ([Formula: see text] = 6.1) systems. The percentages of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in grades 1-2, grade 3, and grades 4-5 for the modified and plain scan MR imaging systems were 0.42% and 0.44%; 6.31% and 6.96%; and 90.36% and 87.79%, respectively. No additional cancers were detected after contrast administration in cases of a plain scan graded 1-2. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a modified MR imaging grading system that improves diagnostic performance for nasopharyngeal carcinoma detection. Contrast was not valuable for low MR imaging grades, and the plain scan shows potential for use in screening programs.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although stratifying individuals with respect to nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) risk with Epstein-Barr virus-based markers is possible, the performance of diagnostic methods for detecting lesions among screen-positive individuals is poorly understood. METHODS: The authors prospectively evaluated 882 participants aged 30 to 70 years who were enrolled between October 2014 and November 2018 in an ongoing, population-based NPC screening program and had an elevated NPC risk. Participants were offered endoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lesions were identified either by biopsy at a follow-up endoscopy or further contact and linkage to the local cancer registry through December 31, 2019. The diagnostic performance characteristics of endoscopy and MRI for NPC detection were investigated. RESULTS: Eighteen of 28 identified NPC cases were detected by both methods, 1 was detected by endoscopy alone, and 9 were detected by MRI alone. MRI had significantly higher sensitivity than endoscopy for NPC detection overall (96.4% vs 67.9%; Pdifference = .021) and for early-stage NPC (95.2% vs 57.1%; P = .021). The sensitivity of endoscopy was suggestively lower among participants who had previously been screened in comparison with those undergoing an initial screening (50.0% vs 81.2%; P = .11). The authors observed a higher overall referral rate by MRI versus endoscopy (17.3% vs 9.1%; P < .001). Cases missed by endoscopy had early-stage disease and were more commonly observed for tumors originating from the pharyngeal recess. CONCLUSIONS: MRI was more sensitive than endoscopy for NPC detection in the context of population screening but required the referral of a higher proportion of screen-positive individuals. The sensitivity of endoscopy was particularly low for individuals who had previously been screened.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for delineating cancers on contrast-enhanced MRI (ce-MRI) but there are clinical scenarios in which administration of contrast is not desirable. We investigated performance of the CNN for delineating primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) on non-contrast-enhanced images and compared the performance to that on ce-MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed primary NPC in 195 patients using a well-established CNN, U-Net, for tumor delineation on the non-contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed (fs)-T2W, ce-T1W and ce-fs-T1W images. The CNN-derived delineations were compared to manual delineations to obtain Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and average surface distance (ASD). The DSC and ASD on fs-T2W were compared to those on ce-MRI. Primary tumor volumes (PTVs) of CNN-derived delineations were compared to that of manual delineations. RESULTS: The CNN for NPC delineation on fs-T2W images showed similar DSC (0.71 +/- 0.09) and ASD (0.21 +/- 0.48 cm) to those on ce-T1W images (0.71 +/- 0.09 and 0.17 +/- 0.19 cm, respectively) (p > 0.05), and lower DSC but similar ASD to ce-fs-T1W images (0.73 +/- 0.09, p < 0.001; and 0.17 +/- 0.20 cm, p > 0.05). The CNN overestimated PTVs on all sequences (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The CNN showed promise for NPC delineation on fs-T2W images in cases where it is desirable to avoid contrast agent injection. The CNN overestimated PTVs on all sequences.},

In addition, most CNNs for primary NPC delineation have focused on contrast-enhanced MRI. To enable the use of CNNs in clinical applications where it would be desirable to avoid contrast agents, such as cancer screening or intra-treatment monitoring, we aim to develop a CNN algorithm with a positional-textural fully-connected attention (FCA) module that can automatically delineate primary NPCs on contrast-free MRI. METHODS: This retrospective study was performed in 404 patients with NPC who had undergone staging MRI. A proposed CNN algorithm incorporated with our positional-textural FCA module (A(proposed) ) was trained on manually delineated tumours (M(1st) ) to automatically delineate primary NPCs on non-contrast-enhanced T2-weighted fat-suppressed (NE-T2W-FS) images. The performance of A(proposed) , three well-established CNNs, Unet (A(unet) ), Attention-Unet (A(att) ) and Dense-Unet (A(dense) ), and a second manual delineation repeated to evaluate human variability (M (2) (nd) ) were measured by comparing to the reference standard M (1) (st) to obtain the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and average surface distance (ASD). The Wilcoxon rank test was used to compare the performance of A(proposed) against A(unet) , A(att) , A(dense) and M (2) (nd) . RESULTS: A(proposed) showed a median DSC of 0.79 (0.10) and ASD of 0.66 (0.84) mm. It performed better than the well-established networks A(unet) [DSC =0.75 (0.12) and ASD =1.22 (1.73) mm], A(att) [DSC =0.75 (0.10) and ASD =0.96 (1.16) mm] and A(dense) [DSC =0.71 (0.14) and ASD =1.67 (1.92) mm] (all P<0.01), but slightly worse when compared to M (2) (nd) [DSC =0.81 (0.07) and ASD =0.56 (0.80) mm] (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed CNN algorithm has potential to accurately delineate primary NPCs on non-contrast-enhanced MRI.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was adapted to automatically detect early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and discriminate it from benign hyperplasia on a non-contrast-enhanced MRI sequence for potential use in NPC screening programs. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 412 patients who underwent T2-weighted MRI, 203 of whom had biopsy-proven primary NPC confined to the nasopharynx (stage T1) and 209 had benign hyperplasia without NPC. Thirteen patients were sampled randomly to monitor the training process. We applied the Residual Attention Network architecture, adapted for three-dimensional MR images, and incorporated a slice-attention mechanism, to produce a CNN score of 0-1 for NPC probability. Threefold cross-validation was performed in 399 patients. CNN scores between the NPC and benign hyperplasia groups were compared using Student's t test. Receiver operating characteristic with the area under the curve (AUC) was performed to identify the optimal CNN score threshold. RESULTS: In each fold, significant differences were observed in the CNN scores between the NPC and benign hyperplasia groups (p < .01). The AUCs ranged from 0.95 to 0.97 with no significant differences between the folds (p = .35 to .92). The combined AUC from all three folds (n = 399) was 0.96, with an optimal CNN score threshold of > 0.71, producing a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 92.4%, 90.6%, and 91.5%, respectively, for NPC detection. CONCLUSION: Our CNN method applied to T2-weighted MRI could discriminate between malignant and benign tissues in the nasopharynx, suggesting that it as a promising approach for the automated detection of early-stage NPC. KEY POINTS: * The convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithm could automatically discriminate between malignant and benign diseases using T2-weighted fat-suppressed MR images. * The CNN-based algorithm had an accuracy of 91.5% with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.96 for discriminating early-stage T1 nasopharyngeal carcinoma from benign hyperplasia. * The CNN-based algorithm had a sensitivity of 92.4% and specificity of 90.6% for detecting early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma.},
